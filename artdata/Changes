28 Oct 2002: v0.1.1
	- Added maximum life time to the SNR.
22 May 2006: v0.1.2
	Use HOME to set PREFIX. Unable to use UNAME to set OS, yet; added
	to TODO.  Sort out the Makefile a bit. Remove the 'unsigned' for
	naxes and related variables (because of changes in Cfitsio).
7 June 2006: v0.1.3
	When the maximum life time support was added, the unlimited lifetime
	mode was lost.  This mode has been restored.  Setting 'life' to 0
	is interpreted as unlimited lifetime.
22 June 2006: v0.1.4
    Fixed print out of pop info (LIFE was printing nambient); no impact on
    results.  Suspect that v0.1.3 introduced a bug. Added debug outputs
    (beware, first try at this was creating Gigabytes of outputs...).
