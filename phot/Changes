Branch (a funny way to say I screwed up)
17 May 2006: [v0.3.1]
    Re-arrange installation path.  Add include statements for gcc 4.0.
22 May 2006: [v0.3.2]
    Use HOME to set PREFIX. Unable to use UNAME to set OS, yet; added
    to TODO.
23 May 2006: [v0.3.3]
    Add install-devel rule to install phot.h.  This is used by other
    software (e.g. fitsnrdist package).

Main trunk
23 May 2006: [v0.3.4]
    - Merge branch to real v0.3.1.  The real v0.3.1 was in the devel directory
      used when was simulating SNR populations for the thesis.
    - Remove the changes done in v0.3.3 as they are obviously unnecessary
      since the 'true' v0.3.1 creates a library and all.
