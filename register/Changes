26 June 2001: [v0.1.0]
	Ported to RedHat Linux

15 November 2001: [v0.1.1]
	Fix Makefile.  Install section wasn't creating directories.

12 August 2002: [v0.1.2]
	Added combmosaic and header file.
22 May 2006: [v0.1.3]
	Use HOME to set PREFIX. Unable to use UNAME to set OS, yet; added
	to TODO. Sorted out the Makefile a bit. Remove the 'unsigned' for
	naxes and related variables (because of changes in Cfitsio).
