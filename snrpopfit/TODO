- *****Write doc.****  At least write some of it!  3.5 yrs after first
  using it, I am completely lost!
- Use UNAME to set OS.
- Get pgxtal, and package it with this code.  Too obscure.
- Set location of mksnrpop and artimg automatically.

BUGS
- I believe there is a memory leak.  When a large number of models are
  asked for (also when snrpopfit call within a loop), the memory usage keeps
  climbing.  Good thing that nowadays, computers have 1-2Gb memory...
  I have notice bad inputs (invalid float) which do not issue an error, put 
  could possible mess up the memory.

- *** Sometimes, snrpopfit with -n 80 will produce less than 80 models
  (79, 78, I saw 72 once).  There was a problem with bad inputs (invalid float)
  in my sequences, but once it happened on the first good input call.  I do not
  know why it happens and I do not know if it affects the results!  The
  time between the models is consistent with a complete, correct model.  Also,
  no model indexes are skipped, it just stops prior to 80.  I have added
  DEBUG outputs to snrpopfit.  Worth noting, this started after artdata was
  update to support unlimited lifetime again.  I do not know why this would
  matter.
